## What is DX (Developer Experience) and how to improve it

The world’s changed.

Developers don’t just want features anymore. They expect intuitive APIs, well-written SDKs, real-world examples, and fast support. They expect things to just work — or they’ll bounce.

In the past few years, dev tools have exploded. But more tools doesn’t mean better tools. What separates a promising product from one that actually takes off is the experience it delivers to the person behind the terminal.

That’s where DX — Developer Experience — comes in.

## Defining DX in practice

Developer Experience is everything that happens between `npm install` and the moment something actually works. It’s what turns a skeptical dev into someone recommending your product in the company Slack.

Bad DX is the opposite. It’s needing to book a demo just to get an API key. It’s a 403 with no message. It’s generic docs that don’t answer a single real question.

Good DX is when everything just clicks. When the docs feel like they were written by someone who actually used the product. When the first request works — and so does the second.

## Onboarding should be instant

There’s no reason to hide your product behind a form or red tape. A good onboarding flow lets a dev solve something real in minutes — no help, no tickets, no reading three pages of docs.

If they can get something useful done before their first coffee, your DX is on the right track.

## Docs are your main interface

A dev product doesn’t need heavy marketing — it needs solid docs.

Working examples. Copy-pasteable code. Straightforward explanations. Clear versioning. Change history. A “Run” button helps — but a working example saves hours.

## SDKs should feel native

An SDK shouldn’t just wrap HTTP requests. It should feel like it *belongs* in the language — with idiomatic errors, proper types, and integration with the local ecosystem. Devs don’t want to adapt. They want to plug in and go.

The more natural it feels, the faster it gets adopted.

## Logs, metrics, and debugging

Nothing kills trust faster than a mystery error.

Structured logs. Visible traces. Messages that explain the problem and point to a fix — that stuff matters. Not just for support teams, but for devs who want to debug solo and move fast.

## API keys and permissions

Creating an API key should be dead simple. Rotating it too. Scope-limited keys? Even better.

DX is also about security without friction. RBAC is a big part of that — giving people access to exactly what they need, nothing more.

## Products that get DX right

Plenty of companies nail this. Stripe, Supabase, Vercel, Clerk, Resend. They all have one thing in common: from onboarding to deploy, everything just feels natural.

It’s not magic. It’s attention to detail. It’s empathy for the dev.

## Why it matters

Because a dev who has a great experience becomes an advocate. They write blog posts, answer issues, share on Twitter, pitch your product in meetings. They recommend it — and that’s worth more than any ad.

## We’re building with DX at the core

At code.dev, every feature starts with the same question: *“What would the ideal experience look like for solving this challenge?”*

We believe a great developer experience is what turns a useful tool into an essential platform.

If you’re building with DX in mind — we want to see it.

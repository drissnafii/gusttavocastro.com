title: The problem isn’t LeetCode. It’s how developers try to practice.

For years, LeetCode has become synonymous with “getting good at programming.”

And technically, it’s not wrong.

The problem is something else.

Most developers use LeetCode as if it were a course, when in reality it’s just a collection of problems.

And problems without a system don’t create skill.

# Where LeetCode works well

LeetCode is excellent at three things:

– Exposing you to classic algorithm patterns
– Forcing logical reasoning under constraints
– Quickly showing when a solution is wrong

As a problem library, it does its job.

But a library doesn’t create habits.
And it certainly doesn’t create consistency.

# Where things start to break

The most common pattern looks like this:

– Solving many problems in a single day
– Going days or weeks without practicing
– Coming back feeling like you “forgot everything”
– Increasing difficulty too early
– Confusing effort with progress

None of this is about lack of discipline or ability.

It’s the absence of a system.

# Practice isn’t solving problems. It’s repetition with feedback.

Solving a single problem brings relief.
Repeating with feedback creates learning.

Real practice requires:

– A predictable rhythm
– Calibrated difficulty
– Immediate feedback
– Visible progression

Without these, the brain doesn’t consolidate anything.
You just accumulate attempts.

# Why most people quit

It’s not because “algorithms are hard.”

It’s because:
– Progress isn’t clear
– Comparisons are unfair
– Effort doesn’t feel rewarded

When there’s no sense of advancement, practice dies.

Every time.

# What we learned building code.dev

When designing code.dev, we started from a simple premise:

Practicing programming is a system design problem, not a willpower problem.

That’s why the focus isn’t:
– Solving as many problems as possible
– Competing on global rankings
– Memorizing solutions

The focus is:
– Practicing every day
– Getting clear feedback
– Seeing real progress

Code is just the medium.
The system is what sustains the habit.

# In summary

LeetCode doesn’t fail.
It just wasn’t built to sustain consistent practice.

Without a system, even the best tool becomes frustrating.

Technical skill doesn’t come from bursts of effort.
It comes from well-designed practice, repeated over time.

That’s what we’re trying to build.
